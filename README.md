# Hey there, I'm Sneha! 👋
## About Me:
I'm Sneha, a proud Xavierian diving headfirst into the world of tech! 

- 📚 **Bookworm Alert:** I'm always diving into new worlds through the pages of a book.<br>
- 📺 **Modern Family Fanatic:** It's my ultimate binge-watch. Can't resist the hilarious antics of the Dunphy-Pritchett-Tucker clan!<br>
- 💻 **Python Django Explorer:** Currently on a quest to master Python Django.<br><br>

## What I'm Up To 🔭<br><br>
Currently, I'm on an excitingg journey learning Python Django, and as a beginner, I'm eager to hone my skills and soak up all the knowledge I can! When I'm not buried in code, you can find me nose-deep in a book or cracking up to episodes of Modern Family. It's all about balance, right? <br><br>

## My Journey in Code

One of my favorite projects is GuessTheMovie, a Python game where you guess popular Bollywood movie dialogues and their corresponding titles. 🎬 It's a blast from the past, packed with iconic lines from classic Bollywood films. Developed during my early Python days, GuessTheMovie holds a special place in my heart as one of my first creations. So, if you're up for a challenge and some Bollywood nostalgia, check out my repos and give it a whirl! Don't forget to share your score—I'd love to see how you do!
