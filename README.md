# Hey there, I‚Äôm Sneha! 

## About Me:
I‚Äôm Sneha, a proud Xavierian diving into the tech world

-  **Bookworm:** I love getting lost in new books and exploring different worlds.<br>
-  **Modern Family Fan:** It's my go-to binge-watch! I can‚Äôt get enough of the hilarious antics of the Dunphy-Pritchett-Tucker family!<br><br>

## What I‚Äôm Up To 
Right now, I‚Äôm learning Python Django as a beginner and really excited about building my skills. While Django is my main focus, I‚Äôm also curious about Web3 and all the possibilities it brings. Blockchain development is definitely on my radar, but for now, I‚Äôm concentrating on getting the hang of Django. When I‚Äôm not coding, you can probably find me with a book or laughing at episodes of *Modern Family*. Finding that balance is key, right? <br><br>

## My Journey in Code 
One of my favorite projects is **GuessTheMovie**(because it is one of the initial project I made), a Python game where you guess popular Bollywood movies from their iconic dialogues. It‚Äôs a fun throwback to classic Bollywood films. I created it during my early days of learning Python, so it has a special place in my heart. If you love a challenge and some Bollywood nostalgia, check out my repos and give it a shot! I‚Äôd love to see how you do!<br><br>

## Seeking Advice 
As I navigate my coding journey, I‚Äôm always open to suggestions from experienced pros like you! If you have any tips or recommendations, I‚Äôd really appreciate it. Let‚Äôs learn and grow together! <br><br>
