# Hey there, I'm Sneha! üëã
## About Me:
I'm Sneha, a proud Xavierian diving headfirst into the world of techh! 

- üìö **Bookworm Alert:** I'm always diving into new worlds through the pages of a book.<br>
- üì∫ **Modern Family Fanatic:** It's my ultimate binge-watch. Can't resist the hilarious escapades of the Dunphy-Pritchett-Tucker familyyy!<br><br>

## What I'm Up To üîç 
Right now, I'm diving into Python Django, learning the ropes as a beginner. I'm really excited to build my skills and soak up all the knowledge I can. While Django is my main focus for now, I'm also super interested in Web3 and the possibilities it brings. Blockchain development is on my radar, but for now, I'm all about getting the basics down with Django. When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me with a book or laughing at episodes of Modern Family. It's all about finding that balance, right? <br><br>

## My Journey in Code  üíª
One of my favorite projects is GuessTheMovie, a Python game where you guess popular Bollywood movies based on their iconic dialogues. üé¨ It's a fun throwback with lines from classic Bollywood films. I made it during my early days of learning Python, and it's one of my first creations, so it holds a special place in my heart. If you love a challenge and some Bollywood nostalgia, check out my repos and give it a try! I'd love to see your scores!<br><br>
